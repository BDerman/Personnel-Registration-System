<h3 align="center"> Systematic Description of the Project;</h3>
<h1>💤 In order for any personnel to log in to the “Personnel Information System”, they must first register on the “Personnel Registration and Information System” page and after completing the registration process, they must go to the page called “Get Personnel Password” and create a personal password to enter the Personnel Information System. The SQL Server System, which is activated during password creation, saves the “Name - Surname - Identification Number” data used by the user who wants to create a password during the registration phase, and the data of the user who creates a password is checked and allowed to create a password. Personnel who have completed the password creation phase without any problems will log in to the “Personnel Information System”, which is the last stage of the application, by going to the application form named “Personnel Login System” and using the “Identification Number - Password” registered in the SQL System.</h1>
